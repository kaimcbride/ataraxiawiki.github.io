<p>Calling all B&amp;W photographers and lovers of the monochromatic photograph!!! Announcing the new StrudelMediaLive B&amp;W Practitioners&rsquo; Meeting Group!!!
((Note: Replace with title of class)) This class gathers a group of your peers to meet every two weeks to present your work for feedback.
The group discussions will be lead by unabashed B&amp;W enthusiast Kai McBride who will also give short presentations on topics designed to stimulate.
Are your photographs communicating what you had hoped? Are there technical aspects or conceptual ideas which could be improved? See your work
with fresh eyes as we look at it together. Not to worry, group critique is not a competitive process but rather a method for articulation that leads to
greater understanding and mutual discovery. No assignments. Self-directed. Show photographs you just made and work that you have been fine tuning
for a while. Incorporate changes suggested during a previous meeting and show your progress. Everyone will be motivated knowing that there is an
upcoming meeting where your fellow B&amp;W photographers are there to urge you on. Join our B&amp;W Appreciation Society and sign up for this class today.</p>

<p>The Black-and-White Practitioners Feedback Group</p>
<p>Calling all black-and-white photographers and lovers of the monochromatic photograph!
Get group feedback on your work in this new class led by unabashed black-and-white enthusiast
Kai McBride who will also give short presentations on topics designed to stimulate.
This class gathers a group of your peers to meet every two weeks to present your work for
feedback — group critique is not a competitive process but rather a method for articulation that
leads to greater understanding and mutual discovery. We’ll discuss both technical aspects and
conceptual ideas that could be improved. There are no assignments in this
class — you’ll be self-directed, showing photographs you just made or work that you have been
fine tuning for a while. You’ll be able to incorporate suggested changes and show your progress.
See your black-and-white photographs with fresh eyes as we look at it together!</p>
